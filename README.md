## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

- First attempt at BEM CSS. I'm afraid I haven't grasped it yet. 
- I'd also like to understand the minmax function. I suspect it could've been useful for this challenge.



### Useful resources

- [Josh Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This is helping me to start  with the right foot.
